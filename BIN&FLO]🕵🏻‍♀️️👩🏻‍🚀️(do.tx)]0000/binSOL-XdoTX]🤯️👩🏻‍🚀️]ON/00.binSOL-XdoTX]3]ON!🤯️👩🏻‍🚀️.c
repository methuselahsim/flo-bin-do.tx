What a unique challenge!

Here's a C implementation of a multi-headed attention transformer in GCC C, 
which takes the query and corpus as text files "query.txt" and "corpus.txt". The
code uses only integers and binary operations to calculate the attention 
weights.

**Note:** This is a simplified implementation, and you may want to consider 
adding more features like padding, masking, and normalization to improve 
performance.

*/

/*

This code defines three functions:

1. `load_corpus`: loads the corpus from a text file and returns an array of 
integers.
2. `load_query`: loads the query from a text file and returns an array of 
integers.
3. `calculate_attention_weights`: calculates the attention weights for each head
using binary operations (XOR and AND) between the query and corpus tokens.

The main function loads the query and corpus, calculates the attention weights, 
and prints the results. Note that this is a simplified example, and you may want
to consider adding more features like padding, masking, and normalization to 
improve performance.

**Compile the code:**
```bash
gcc -o attention_transformer attention_transformer.c
```
**Run the code:**
```bash
./attention_transformer
```
This will load the query and corpus from the text files "query.txt" and 
"corpus.txt", calculate the attention weights, and print the results.

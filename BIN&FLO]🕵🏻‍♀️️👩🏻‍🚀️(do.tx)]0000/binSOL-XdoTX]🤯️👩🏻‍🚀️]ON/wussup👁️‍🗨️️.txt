💰️its already made us like "6+ WORKING binary tx's" (vs 0 float)
this keeps it simple AND is our ethos. since we ruled out llama2.c
this is fine. leGO! 🅱️{and if anything ever happened ,we know it would be ez 2 replace...}❎️(and its ez 2 mod query 2+ we HAVE to modify them
(maybe multx) and "ollam3"HAS 2 understand the code (MULTX) , so "float" is OUT pretty much 4 good.{🎅️we wanted bin so w/e🎅️})❎️🅱️💰️
👁️‍🗨️️(this maybe better for pushing full thru 2 our own modular corpus)
(But keep in mind it actualy is doing what u want i guess. 
tho beggars cant be choosers if u get "LLM" fx() , lets keep going)

🧧️🧧️i know u can do even better querying if u understand wut the code is doign , this is a good place 2 "GROK" cuz we KNOW were gonna get
a runnable BINARY TX no matter wut , yw 🧧️🧧️
👍️if ur asking for binary mods, its basically gonna do w/e u ask
like pimp-my-ride... so groking its gonna yeild fruit...
🍇️JUST DO IT🍇️👍️
❓️❓️❓️❓️❓️❓️❓️❓️❓️

to really figure out if were on track or not, 

we need a "minimum testable "corpus/ query" to test a binary transformer with"
to make sure it will work with bigger corpuses . 
along with a legend of expected results. 
what would that discpline be called. calibrating? tuning? debugging? 
❓️❓️❓️❓️❓️❓️❓️
❗️ive found that using 
Q = "0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 1" for query ( 0 or 1 ) 
and 
C = "0 0 0 0  \n
0 0 0 1"
"(bank with zero and 1) 

will yeild an interesting enough result for us 2 tweak 2 get 
"EXACTLY WUT WE WANT, and 
❣️
"2.nu-bin-XdoTX]0003.c"   << is doing this just find 
(its out is 2 much but it def switches, i like it) ❣️

code a binary decoder only multi headed attention transformer in gcc c. (NOT CPP) . make it take query and corpus as text files "query.txt" and "corpus.txt".

make sure the code can correctly calculate the attention weights based on the query and corpus tokens, and then use those weights to calculate a meaningful output for each attention head.

 make sure it can compile. 
 
  ➕️
 additionally if you have memory space impliment these as well
 
 * Embedding layer
* Positional encoding
* Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers
* Self-attention mechanism
* Feed-forward network (FFN)

( you shouldn't need to use float, just int. always use binary numbers and binary operations before using decimal )

💰️this one will usually run , especially if u remove requirements. 
if u start adding requirements it gets hit or miss💰️

🎅️🤣️all these are working, and giving meaningful outputs .vs float
was never gonna work lmfao wow🎅️🤣️
🤯️MIRACLE PROMPT 2 GO 2 CODEVAULT MARS ETC🐙️

* last attempt (*out of like 5 , this one is ON ! MIRACLE MAYBE USE THIS ONE FIRST

🤯️
🙏️the fact that it did ALL THOSE THINGS , BUT ESPECIALLY 
"make sure the code can correctly calculate the attention weights based on the query and corpus tokens."
ushould be very greatful, i hate 2 say this but u may not get 
one again.(was rare tbh, was gonna give up!) tho u can try if u need mods , after groking 📿️this is literally the best possible combination , no floats are used or even math libary, keep pushing in this direction, if u dont understand just ask llm all about thsi peice of code =👿️" 2.nu-bin-XdoTX]0003]ON!🤯️.c " 👿️📿️🙏️

The history of artificial intelligence began in the 1950s with the 
development of the first AI programs.
AI has since become a rapidly growing field with many applications, 
including robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing.

In recent years, AI has been used to make decisions that affect 
people's lives, such as determining creditworthiness or predicting 
medical outcomes.
The potential benefits of AI are significant, but so are the risks, and
it is important to ensure that these systems are designed and used in a
way that is fair and beneficial to all.

In "Deep Learning", Yann LeCun et al. introduced the concept of 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition.
The paper demonstrated that CNNs could learn features from raw images 
without human intervention, leading to state-of-the-art performance on 
several image classification tasks.
